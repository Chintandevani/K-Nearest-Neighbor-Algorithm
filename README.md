# Using K-Nearest-Neighbour(KNN) Algorithm the predict group of customers 
This model predicts the type of service (Plus Service , Basic Service , Total Service , E - Service) taken by a customer by putting them into some groups (3,1,4,2 respectively). Customers are divided into certain groups depending upon the certain features present in the data set. KNN machine learning algorithm has been used to group the customers and predict the new groups.
